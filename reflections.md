## Reflections

This assignment highlighted how small, repeated operational errors can accumulate into major problems.

Designing daily micro-checks in Task 1 showed the importance of prevention over correction.
In Task 2, structuring communication helped reduce doctor involvement to only judgment-based decisions.

Overall, the exercise reinforced the value of simple, repeatable systems in high-pressure clinic environments.
